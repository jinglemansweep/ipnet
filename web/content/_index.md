# Ipswich MeshCore Network

![MeshCore](/images/meshcore.png)

Welcome to the home of the [MeshCore](https://meshcore.co.uk/) mesh network in Ipswich, Suffolk, UK which runs legally on the EU/UK 869.525MHz frequency.

IPNet is a community network that is open to all users for emergency messaging, location tracking, IoT sensors and more. The network is entirely non-profit and is run on hardware that is owned and managed by the community.

MeshCore uses [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa), a low-power, long-range radio system to send small packets of information like simple text messages, sensor values, GPS coordinates etc.

It does not rely on mobile cellular networks or WiFi for operation, so is perfect for when no cell signal is available. 

New nodes can join the mesh if in range of an existing node. Ideally new nodes should be located in high areas (e.g. top of hills) and nodes and antennae should be installed as high as possible in properties (e.g. roof, loft, etc).
