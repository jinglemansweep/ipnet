Welcome to the home of a new [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) mesh network in Ipswich, Suffolk, UK which runs legally on the EU 868MHz (`EU_868`) frequency using the default `LongFast` profile.

IPNet is a community network that is open to all users for emergency messaging, location tracking, IoT sensors and more. 
The network is entirely non-profit and is run on hardware that is owned and managed by the community.

Meshtastic uses [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa), a low-power, long-range radio system to send small packets of information like simple text messages, sensor values, GPS coordinates etc.
It does not rely on mobile cellular networks or WiFi for operation, so is perfect for when no cell signal is available. Typically, LoRa works best when there is line-of-sight between each node in the mesh, but still works fairly well albeit with much limited range within residential areas.

New nodes can join the mesh if in range of an existing node. Ideally new nodes should be located in high areas (e.g. top of hills) and nodes and antennae should be installed as high as possible in properties (e.g. roof, loft, etc).

Some initial testing in the Stoke Park area of Ipswich has successful transmissions over 500m through several houses.
